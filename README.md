Signature Comparison and Detection

Description

This project is a signature comparison and detection system designed to extract signatures from documents and compare them with a reference signature to determine their similarity. It leverages a trained machine learning model to detect signatures and compute a similarity score, indicating whether two signatures are likely from the same person. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to upload documents and reference signatures easily. This project is useful for applications like document verification, forensic analysis, and automated signature authentication.

Key Features





Signature Detection: Automatically identifies and extracts signatures from scanned documents or images.



Signature Comparison: Compares a detected signature with a reference signature using a trained model.



Similarity Scoring: Outputs a similarity score (0-100%) to quantify the match between signatures.



Decision Making: Determines if signatures are from the same individual based on a threshold.



User Interface: A Tkinter-based GUI for seamless interaction, including file uploads and result visualization.

Use Cases





Verifying signatures on legal documents, contracts, or checks.



Assisting in forensic signature analysis.



Automating signature validation in digital workflows.

Technologies Used





Python 3.x: Core programming language for the project.



Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.



OpenCV: For image processing and signature detection.



TensorFlow (or specify your model framework, e.g., PyTorch): For the trained machine learning model.



NumPy: For numerical computations.



Pillow (PIL): For handling image inputs.



scikit-learn (if used): For additional machine learning utilities.

Installation
